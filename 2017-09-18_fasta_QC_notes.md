# Final Project Reflections (Lab Notebook, Last Modified 2017-09-18)

The final output for this project is, for the most part, finished. However, 
aesthetically it could look better given the variation in data sizes (one can see 
that the H1N1 files are larger than the FastaSeqCL, animal, crab, or invertebrates 
data. Thus, aesthetically, what I would do next time is somehow reorder the output so 
that the cleanest, smallest data files are output first, then the larger data sets at 
the bottom. What I found more concerning was that while the animal, invertebrate, and 
crab FASTA files were able to spit out the first three or last three lines of 
sequence, the larger data sets spit out much larger quantities. Had I been doing an 
experiment analyzing all data, the disproportionate amount of sequence reads would 
not be helpful.
